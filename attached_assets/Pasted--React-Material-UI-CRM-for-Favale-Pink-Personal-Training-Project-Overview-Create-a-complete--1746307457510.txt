# React Material-UI CRM for Favale&Pink Personal Training

## Project Overview
Create a complete CRM application using React and Material-UI for Favale&Pink, a personal training company. **The entire interface must be in Portuguese language**, including all labels, messages, and UI content. The application needs two primary screens: a Lead Management screen and a Dashboard, designed to handle approximately 20,000 leads.

## Technical Requirements

### Stack and Setup
- React 18+ with functional components and hooks
- Material-UI v5+ for component library

- Custom theme based on Favale&Pink brand colors (primary: #E91E63 or similar pink, secondary: dark purple/black, with white accents)
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Replit Database for data persistence if available

### Project Structure
- Modular component architecture
- Separation of concerns (components, hooks, services, utils)
- Custom theme configuration in a separate file
- Consistent naming conventions and folder structure

5. Build Dashboard with visualizations
6. Implement state management and data persistence
7. Add filtering, sorting, and advanced features

9. Test across different screen sizes

## Expected Deliverables
- Complete React application with all specified features
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- Portuguese language UI throughout the application
- Well-structured and commented code
- README with setup and usage instructions

## Additional Notes
- The brand logo should be prominently displayed in the header
- All date formats should follow Brazilian standard (DD/MM/YYYY)
